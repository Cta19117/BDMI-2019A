In this class I learned the QuickSort and BucketSort algorithm. I found out that depending on that there is no better general solution, but instead it depends on the case. While comparison based models  (MergeSort, QuickSort, InsertionSort) can handle any arbitrary comparable objects, it's runtime is at least O(nlog(n)). 

On the other hand the BucketSort and RadixSort have a much smaller runtime O(n), but the values need to be known before in order to initialize the buckets. This method will also take up more space and is therefore not suitable for large arrays and huge integers.

I also got familiar with the basic syntax for TensorFlow and numpy.
