This week we learnt the different organizations of Neural Network and their applications in voice processing.

### Convolutional Neural Network

Convolutional neural network is a kind of forward network. 

They make use of the operation known as convolution which uses a matrix kernel to swipe through an certain area to get the sum product of the kernel and the matrix it covers.

Among different NNs, RNN (recursive neural network) is the most commonly used structure in voice processing. It's the kind of NN that updates the current status with the upcoming time series.

Besides, LSTM (long short term memory) is an improved structure of RNN, retaining the "memory" from the previous status, eliminating the challenge of diminish of gradient faced by RNN.
