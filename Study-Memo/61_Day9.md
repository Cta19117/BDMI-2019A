## neuron

visualization tools for models

## CNN

- convolution and pooling
  - convolution for identifying border
  - pooling for discarding duplicate border information in a neighbouring region
  - adjacent convolution may follow nonlinear activation for better performance(why?)

## audioRec

- ASR
- CLDNN

## RNN

- RNN
  - only record latest states
- BRNN
- LSTM
  - record history states
  - $\sigma()$ as gate for proportions of information flow
