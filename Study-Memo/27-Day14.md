In this lesson we practiced to use the HUAWEI AI board to achieve the task of AI.

### HUAWEI Atlas Development Board

The manager from HUAWEI passionately gave us a presentation of the basic knowledge of the AI Board.

The board has a Da Vinci structure developed by HUAWEI.

It boasts the high efficiency in the usage of resources, and the level of the hardware is very high.

We cannot really understand much about what the manager was talking about, since we haven't learnt much about the chip and hardware.

Anyway, we managed to install linux system to our computer and made the board work! (recording videos)
