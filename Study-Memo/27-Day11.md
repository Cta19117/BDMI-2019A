This week we get exposed to the most exciting part of machine intelligence, Computer Vision (CV).

### Computer Vision

There are at least five subject we want to address in CV: classification, localization, object detection, segmentation, and scene analysis and marking.

The fundamental in processing images using machine intelligence is that we input a picture comprising of pixels (or the vector numbers for pixels indicating the color or depth of each pixel), and then use traditional CV methods or artificial neural network to learn the outcomes.

As for object detection, we use precision and correctness to evaluate the performance of the task. Both index can be defined by True/False Positive/Negative.

We learnt basic networks in CV, Regional-CNN, Faster R-CNN and so on.

Also, we found out the open source program PoseNet very interesting. It is a pre-trained model putting out skeleton of persons (and the confidence level of each joint) with input of 2D images containing persons.
