In this lesson we learnt Learned System and Big Data.

### Learned System and Big Data

As the magnitude of data growing fast, we have take into account the time consumption when we read in/out the data from the storage system. Thus the data base organization becomes important as we apply more and more data-driven methods to solve real-life problems.

In this case, SQL becomes useful again (as it has been debated whether or not necessary for data manipulation in the history for long times).

Here, we also need to introduce distributed system for data backup and higher efficiency in data retrieval.

### MADLib Introduction

Yandong Yao and Jiang Wu from Pivotal company each gave us a presentation.

First, we learnt the development of data process platforms and the powerfulness of GreenPlum, as one of those.

Second, we watched a demo as how MADLib could easily manage big data in AI scenarios with high efficiency and high accuracy.
