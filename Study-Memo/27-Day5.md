# 27-Day5

This Week, I:

- learnt Hash List as an extension of Bucket sort
  -- Those two methods are alike in that the key is to define a function from the elements to the "buckets"

  -- The key to constrain the complexity of Hash to O(1) is to avoid collision. 

  -- The way to achieve the above is to define random uniform function

- learnt the organization and importance of Database
  -- and got some sense of SQL Structured Query Language which is the most basic language.

- run the ipynb codes of SQL and so to get familiar with them.
