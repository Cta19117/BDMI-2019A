## 27-Day8

In this week we learnt more advanced skills in tensorflow, including the usage of computer vision and audio processing libraries.

As for mechanisms of neural networks and machine learning, we learnt the analogy between NN and human neural system, and learnt the basics of data-based modeling method (so called machine learning).

I am really excited to see the visualization of neural network on TensorFlow PlayGround, which amazed me how the algorithms could learn the bizarre classification regions.
