## 27-Day2

To save the problem of switching Chinese and English keyboards when typing in markdown format, I'll stick to English version for all the .md files.

### Week 2:

- Got used to Python language by running I/O codes on jupyternotebook
- Learnt to multiply large number by "divide and conquer", that is, to recursively divide the number into parts with less digits, multiply the smaller numbers separately, and then add them together. We also analyzed the complexity of some common ways of dividing the numbers.
- Learnt the usage of recursion in sorting arrays.
