## sorting algorithm

bubble sort

median & selection

## data structure

- array in Numpy: 任意维数组/矩阵
  - can perform dot, plus and other manuplations

- linked list
  - head -> item 1 -> item 2
  - one direction/two direction/circular linked list

## linked list algorithm

- binary search tree
  - recursive in searching
  - smaller on the left, larger on the right
- redblack tree
  - binary branches
  - nodes are red or black
  - root and leaf nodes are block
  - child nodes of red node are black
  - every path to leaf of certain node contains same amounts of black nodes
- B+ tree
  - similar to balanced binary search tree
  - difference: more than two branches
