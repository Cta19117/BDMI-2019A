# 27-Day4

This Week, I:

- learnt Bucket Sort and found its resemblance to hash array
-- and studied their complexity reduction compared to comparative sort, and its dependence on log-base
- learnt the structure of 2-3-4 tree and Red-Black-Tree, and their correspondence
-- and learnt how to insert data and separate a node
- got more familiar with more ipynb codes of lists



I feel like the TAs made their points clear. Good jobs!
