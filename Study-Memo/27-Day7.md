## 27-Day 6

This week we mainly studied several operations on database language Structured Query Language.

We learnt more advanced syntax of the SQL like searching related information in different tables and combine them together.

We also learnt some basics of tensorflow at last and got some ideas about data types (constant, placeholder and so on) and some numerical analysis.
