## 27-Day3 Course Summary

### In this course, we:

- learnt tricks for typing in equations in markdown
- studied a few usages of numpy library and tensorflow
- analyzed the mechanism and complexity of QuickSort



#### After this course, I am more interested in studying different sorting methods. The bobo sort method is really interesting and thought-provoking though not efficient.
